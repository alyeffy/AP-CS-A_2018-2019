### Vending Machine Unit Test Lab

You are provided with `VendingMachine.java` and `Drink.java`. They are an implementation of a very simple vending machine. The vending machine only has 1 slot, where any drink can be placed. Drinks can only be loaded from the front of the machine, meaning that the first drink in will be the last drink out. The vending machine only takes exact amount for payment as well.

Based on the provided classes and description above, write unit tests in the same format covered in Lesson 10, where each method of both classes are tested, and make sure you cover all the test cases. Create your tests in a new class, e.g. `UnitTestVM.java`.
