### Abstract Classes
- a **superclass** that represents an **abstract concept**, and so **should not be instantiated**
- e.g. a platform game like **[centipede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede_(video_game))**, has different characters such as the **player**, the **centipede**, **spiders**, **fleas**, and **scorpions**.
- these all **share certain features** (e.g. location, the way they are displayed etc.), and can thus be declared as subclasses of an abstract class, called **Sprite**
- instances of the player, centipede, spiders, fleas, and scorpions will be created by the game, but there will be **no instances of Sprite**
- an abstract class may contain **abstract methods**, which are methods with **no implementation code, just a header**
- the reasoning behind having abstract methods is that there is **no good default code for them**
- this means that every **subclass** will **have to override** the abstract methods
- thus, the **abstract methods are placeholders**
- any class that contains any abstract methods MUST be declared an **abstract class**

```java
public abstract class AbstractClass { // use the abstract keyword to declare a class abstract

  // data fields

  // abstract methods with varied implementation for each subclass
  public abstract int intMethod();
  public abstract String stringMethod();

  // method that should definitely be in each subclass with the same implementation
  public void mutator() {
    // implementation code
  }

}

public class SubClass extends AbstractClass {

  // data fields

  // abstract methods replaced
  public int intMethod() {
    // implementation code, notice no use of super
  }

  public String stringMethod() {
    // implementation code, notice no use of super
  }

  public void mutator() {
    super.mutator(); // not an abstract method
  }

}
```

### Interfaces
- a collection of related methods, either **abstract** (headers only), or default (implementation provided in the interface). NOTE: default methods are new in Java 8 and will not be tested on the AP exam
- **non-default methods** include abstract and public methods i.e. **no need to explicitly include these keywords**
- therefore, they provide a **framework of behaviour** for any class
- the classes that implement the same interface may represent completely different objects
- e.g. some classes might implement a **FlyingObject** interface, with the methods `fly` and `isFlying`, such as **Bird**, **Airplane**, **Missile**, **Bee**, and **Witch**, but they will all have completely different implementations of it
- a class that implements an interface can define any number of methods, and should have **implementations for all non-default (abstract) methods** in the interface, UNLESS it is an abstract class
- a class that extends a **superclass** can also **directly implement an interface**
- a class can have **one direct superclass**, but it can implement **any number of interfaces**
- as with abstract classes, **no instances can be created for an interface**
```java
public interface FlyingObject {
  void fly(); // method that simulates flight of an object
  boolean isFlying(); // true if object is in flight, false otherwise
}

public class Bird implements FlyingObject {

}

public class Owl extends Bird implements FlyingObject { // extends must be BEFORE implements

}

public class Owl extends Bird implements FlyingObject, Carnivore {

}
```

### Abstract Classes vs. Interfaces
- use an **abstract** class for an object that is **application specific** but incomplete without its subclasses
- consider using an **interface** when its methods are **suitable** for the program but could be **equally applicable** in other programs
- an interface doesn't typically have **implementations**, but and abstract class does
- an interface cannot contain **instance variables**, but an abstract  class can
- it is **not possible to create an instance** of either an interface object or abstract class object

### HOMEWORK
**Assignments**:
- all odd-numbered questions for the **Classes and Objects** MCQ handout I gave you (I will be marking these as assessment)
- (optional) the rest of the questions for the **Classes and Objects** handout (just for extra practice, I will post the answers in this [issue]())

**Prep for Next Class**:
- N/A
