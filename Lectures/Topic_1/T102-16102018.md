### Java Packages
As we've mentioned before, there are several different Java packages you can utilize that often have built-in methods or classes that work really well, so you don't have to re-invent the wheel. Here's how to **import** them:
```java
import packagename.*;         // imports all classes in this package
import packagename.Classname; // imports specific class from this package
```
In Eclipse, you can create your own packages as well, and place related classes in them. Classes in the **same package** have access to each others' **public** methods, constructors etc. without having to import them.

### Java Syntax
We will now be going over basic built-in types and operations in Java that are common in plenty of other programming languages. As with every language, it is important to get the **syntax** right so that the **compiler** is able to translate our instructions into machine language.

### Identifiers
- the **name** of a class, method, etc., which obeys a certain naming convention depending on whether it is a constructor, method, variable etc., as mentioned in the previous lesson
- in general, identifiers are any sequence of letters, digits, and the underscore character
- they are also case-sensitive and may not begin with a digit

### Built-In Types
Anything that is declared in Java has a type, and the built-in (primitive) ones in the AP subset are:
- `int`: an integer
- `boolean`: either **true** or **false**
- `double`: a double precision floating-point number

You can also convert variables to a specific type by **casting**:
```java
int total, n; // the comma separates 2 identifiers (total and n), both of which are ints
double average;
average = (double) total/n;
average = total/(double) n; // this also works

int num = 5;
double realNum = num; // num will automatically be cast to double in this case since an integer can clearly be a double

double cost = 10.95
int numDollars = (int) cost; // Without the explicit cast, an error will occur
```
Note that casting a **double** to an **int** will **truncate** it, not round it off.

### Integers
- ints are stored in Java exactly, as a string of **bits** (binary digits)
- the Java built-in integral type, **byte**, uses one byte (**eight bits**) of storage, the **short**(not in AP subset) uses two bytes, and the **long**(not in AP subset) uses eight bytes
- ints in Java use **four bytes (32 bits)**, where the one bit will be for the sign (i.e. positive/negative)
- this means that the largest possible integer stored is 2^31 - 1, and in general, an **n-bit integer** uses **n/8** bytes of storage and stores integers from -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1)-1
- the Java constant `Integer.MAX_VALUE` holds the max value an int can hold (2^31 - 1), and the `Integer.MIN_VALUE` constant holds the minimum value an int can hold (-2^31)
- if you attempt to store a value bigger than those constants, you will get an **overflow error**

### Floating-Point Numbers
- the two built-in types in Java that store real numbers are the **float**(not in AP subset) which uses four bytes and the **double**, which uses eight
- in doubles, one bit is used for the sign as well, and if floating-point numbers are converted to binary, most cannot be represented exactly, leading to **round-off errors**, which are compounded by arithmetic operations
- no exception will be thrown for these errors, but if an operation gives an **undefined result** (e.g. if you take the square root of a negative number), `NaN` (not a number) will be returned, and if an operation returns an **infinitely large/small number** (e.g. dividing by zero), `Infinity` or `-Infinity` will be returned

### Binary, Hexadecimal, and Octal
- FUN FACT: Binary is used by computers because the values **0** and **1** can represent **on/off** signals. Computers run on electricity, which can be controlled using switches or logic gates. This is known as **data representation**.
- **Binary** is just a form of expressing numbers with a **base of 2 (with digits 0 and 1)**, rather than the standard **decimal** format we are used to that expresses numbers with a base of 10 (with digits 0 - 9)
- Similarly, **hexadecimal (hex)** uses a **base of 16 (with digits 0 - 9, and A-F)**, and **octal** uses a **base of 8 (with digits 0 - 7)**
- Hex tends to be the standard for storing numbers due to its **compactness** and ease of conversion to/from **binary**, and are often denoted using the prefix `0x` or `0X` e.g. `0xC2A`
- The images below show how to convert decimal to binary and vice versa, and binary to hex and vice versa:

### Arithmetic Operators
| **Operator** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| + | addition | 3 + x |
| - | subtraction | p - q |
| * | multiplication | 6 * i |
| / | division | 10 / 4 (returns 2, not 2.5!) |
| % | mod (remainder) | 11 % 8 (returns 3) |

- These operators can be applied to **ints** and **doubles**, and if an operation involves both, a **double** result will be returned.
- If division involves two **ints**, truncation will result, but if at least one is a **double**, regular floating-point division is used (no trunctation)
- What is **modulo (mod)** and when/why would we use it? Consider the method below that finds the number of factors of a given integer (NOTE: you may want to understand the rest of this lecture to help you understand this example better):

```java
public int numFactors(int num) {
  total = 1; // starts with 1, since every integer has 1 as a factor
  n = num; // stores the original input number
  while (n != 1) { // keep looping while n is not 1
    if ((num % n) == 0) // if the remainder of num / n is equal to 0 i.e. no remainder, so the result is a whole number
      total++;          // then that value of n is a factor of num, so increment the total number of factors by 1
    n--; // decrement the value of n by 1 to test the next value. This is executed every loop until the exit condition (n == 1) is reached, at which point the loop will stop.
  }
  return total; // returns the total number of factors
}
```
Arithmetic operators follow the standard precedence rules (order of operations, **BEDMAS**), and are operated from left to right (however, **casting** has the highest priority):
1. parentheses, from innermost to outermost
2. `*`, `/`, `%`
3. `+`, `-` (lowest priority)

### Relational Operators
- These are used for **boolean expressions** that return booleans
- Should only be used for **primitive** types (e.g. ints, doubles, booleans), not user-defined types
- Do not directly compare floating-point values, since they cannot always be represented exactly in computer memory

| **Operator** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| == | equal to | if (x == 100) |
| != | not equal to | if (age != 19) |
| > | greater than | if (salary > 30000) |
| < | less than | if (grade < 65) |
| >= | greater than or equal to | if (age >= 16) |
| <= | less than or equal to | if (height <= 6) |

### Logical (Boolean) Operators
- Also used for **boolean expressions** that return booleans
- Work similar to set notation used in mathematical probability

| **Operator** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| ! | NOT | if (!found) |
| && | AND | if (x < 3 && y > 4) |
| \|\| | OR | if (age < 2 \|\| height < 4) |

- For compound boolean expressions, using **truth tables** are really useful.

| && | T | F |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| T | T | F |
| F | F | F |

| \|\| | T | F |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| T | T | T |
| F | T | F |

| ! | |
| :---: | :---: |
| T | F |
| F | T |
- Expressions are evaluated left to right, and as soon as the value of the entire expression is known even before the entire expression is evaluated, evaluation stops automatically and the result is returned (**short-circuit evaluation**)
- e.g. `if (numScores != 0 && scoreTotal/numScores > 90)` will not throw a run-time `ArithmeticException` (division-by-zero) if the value of **numScores** is 0, because the `numScores != 0` will evaluate to `false` and without having to evaluate second expression

### Assignment Operators
| **Operator** | **Example** | **Meaning** |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| = | x = 2 | simple assignment |
| += | x += 4 | x = x + 4 |
| -= | y -= 6 | y = y - 6 |
| *= | p *= 5 | p = p * 5 |
| /= | n /= 10 | n = n / 10 |
| %= | n %= 10 | n = n % 10 |

- other than the simple assignment operator, all of these are **compound assignment operators**
- **chaining** of assignment statements is allowed, e.g. `next = prev = sum = 0;`

### Increment and Decrement Operators
| **Operator** | **Example** | **Meaning** |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| ++ | i++ | i is incremented by 1 |
| -- | i-- | i is decremented by 1 |

### Operator Precedence
| **Priority** | **Operators** |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 | !, ++, -- |
| 2 | *, /, % |
| 3 | +, - |
| 4 | <, >, <=, >= |
| 5 | ==, != |
| 6 | && |
| 7 | \|\| |
| 8 | =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %= |

### Input/Output
- Input methods will not be on the AP exam
- The only output methods you need to know are `System.out.print` (prints **without** going to a new line) and `System.out.println` (prints and then goes to a new line), which print an item (e.g. a string, number, boolean) to the console

### Escape Sequences
- These are used to print special characters. There are several, but you only need to know these 3 for the exam:

| **Escape Sequence** | **Meaning** |
| :---: | --- |
| \n | new line |
| \\" | double quote |
| \\ | backslash |

### Control Structures
These allow you to make statements of a program run in a non-sequential order and consist of 2 general types: **decision-making** and **iteration**

### Decision-Making Control Structures
These include the `if`, `if...else`, and `switch` (not in AP subset) statements that allow selective control of which path to follow based on the truth value of boolean expressions.

```java
// IF Statements (1 case)
if (boolean expression) {
  // statements that evaluate if and only if expression evaluates to true
}

// IF...ELSE Statements (2 cases)
if (boolean expression) {
  // statements that evaluate if expression evaluates to true
} else {
  // statements that evaluate otherwise (i.e. if expression evaluates to false)
}

// NESTED IF Statement (Sequential cases)
if (boolean expr1)
  if (boolean expr2) // expr2 will only be evaluated if and only if expr1 evaluates to true
    statement;

// equivalent to:
if (boolean expr1 && boolean expr2)
  statement;

// EXTENDED IF Statement (Multiple possible cases)
if (boolean expr1) // 1st case
  statement; // evaluated if above case is true, after which any cases below will not be evaluated
else if (boolean expr2) // 2nd case
  statement;
else if (boolean expr3) // 3rd case
  statement; // evaluated if above case is true, after which any cases below will not be evaluated
else
  statement; // evaluated when none of the above cases occur
// Notice that for the sake of efficiency, the 1st case should preferably be the case you anticipate to be most frequent/likely, and the rest should follow in descending order of frequency/likelihood
```

### Iteration
As the name suggests, these control structures allow the computer to perform a specific set of tasks **repeatedly**: the `for` loop, the `while` loop, and the `do...while` loop (not in AP exam)

### for Loops
Allow you to specify the **start**, **end**, and **incrementation** between each iteration
```java
for (initialization; termination condition; update statement) {
  // statements in the loop body to be executed from start to end in specified number of increments
}
```

### for-each Loops
These are useful for iterating over every element in an **array** or **collection**
```java
for (SomeType element : collection) {
  // statements in the loop body to be executed for each element of some type in the collection
}
```
- These hide the index variable that is used with arrays
- They should be used for **accessing** elements, not replacing/removing them as you traverse along the collection
- What if there is a case when you want to exit the loop **before** the specified termination point? Use the `break` statement to break out of the loop!

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // statements for each iteration
  if (condition where the loop should be exited)
    break; // loop is existed and remaining iterations will not take place
}
```
### while Loops
These are useful when you don't necessarily know how many iterations you will need to perform the operations
```java
while (boolean expression) {
  // statements in the loop body to be executed if and only if the boolean expression is true
}
```
Note that since you are **not declaring a specific termination condition**, the statements in the loop body should **eventually result in the boolean expression evaluating to false**, or you will create an **infinite loop** that never finishes being executed!

```java
// while loop that is equivalent to the last for loop above
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  // statements for each iteration
  if (condition where loop should be exited)
    break; // yes, breaks can be used for while loops too!
  i++; // incrementation step, so we know that the boolean expression will eventually evaluate to false
  // end of loop body so loop body is executed again from the start with new value of i
}
```

### Control Flow Diagrams
These are NOT part of the AP subset, but you may prefer to use them (vs. writing out each step) when trying to figure out what a program is doing or planning what a method you should do before you write it on the exam. For fun, here's a [good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0xgjUhEG3U) of how they can be used. The following image shows the control flow of the for loop and its equivalent while loop from the example above:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10457017/47373300-64db3880-d6a0-11e8-8c8f-a1daebed89b4.png)

### Errors and Exceptions
- an **exception** is an error that occurs during the execution of a Java program
- an **unchecked exception** is one that is automatically handled by Java's standard exception-handling methods, which **terminate execution**. The ones in the AP subset are:

| **Exception** | **Example that causes it** |
| :---: | --- |
| ArithmeticException | dividing by zero |
| NullPointerException | invoking a method with a null reference |
| ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException | using a negative index to access an array element (not possible) |
| IndexOutOfBoundsException | using an index to access an array element that does not exist (larger than length of array) |
| IllegalArgumentException | when parameter doesn't satisfy a method's precondition e.g. length cannot be negative |

```java
public double getRectangleArea (double length, double width) {
  if (length <= 0 || width <= 0) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Length/width must be greater than zero"); // Optional error message that you can specify (or not, but it will be useful when debugging) that gets printed to the console
  } else {
    return length * width;
  }
}
```
- conversely, a **checked exception** (not part of AP subset) is one where you provide code to **handle** the exception, e.g. using a `try`/`catch`/`finally` statement, or an explicit `throw new ...Exception` statement
- exceptions are not necessarily caused by bugs in the code e.g. an unexpected end of file could be due to a broken network connection

### HOMEWORK
**Assignments**:
- since some of you are struggling with the Eclipse setup, I am not assigning homework for this week (because you were likely unable to do the work from last class or are still in the process of completing it).

**Prep for Next Class**:
- keep working at the Eclipse and GitHub setup, and we will go through any setup issues for a bit at the beginning of the next class and starting our first lab!
