### Inheritance - Superclasses + Subclasses
- as one would inherit certain attributes from a parent, we might want to establish a similar relationship between similar objects e.g. objects that are a **subset** or **type/kind** of another object
- **inheritance** refers to a relationship between objects that share characteristics, specifically where a new class (the **subclass**) is created from an existing class (the **superclass**)
- the **subclass** inherits the **state** and **behaviour** of the **superclass**, but alters them with features unique to the new class
- inheritance is an effective way to **reuse** and **refactor** code that is similar, especially if the code for the superclass has been tested and debugged, so the only new code required for the subclass are any of its additional characteristics

### Inheritance Hierarchy
- a **subclass** can be a **superclass** for another subclass, creating an **inheritance hierarchy**
- inheritance relationships are also called **is-a** relationships, where a **GreatBall is-a PokeBall**, and an **UltraBall is-a Pokeball** etc.
- these relationships are **transitive** i.e. if a **GradStudent is-a Student** and a **Student is-a Person**, then a **GradStudent is-a Person**

### Rules for Subclasses
1. a subclass inherits the **public variables and methods** of its superclass, but it cannot **redefine them as private**, and does not inherit the **private instance variables and methods** of is superclass
2. a subclass this cannot **directly access** the private members of its superclass; only by using **accessor** or **mutator** methods
3. a subclass may have **additional private/public/static methods and instance variables** that are not in the superclass
4. a subclass should define its own **constructors**. A subclass constructor can be implemented with a call to the `super` method, which invokes the superclass constructor.
5. a subclass may **override** a method it inherits (**method-overriding**, or **partial-overriding** if part of the original code is retained), UNLESS it is a **static method**. The `super` method can also be used to invoke the corresponding method in the superclass.


```java
public class GradStudent extends Student { // the keyword extends tells the compiler that GradStudent is-a Student

  public GradStudent() { // default constructor
    super(); // uses the default constructor of the Student class, must be used in first line if used
    gradID = 0; // initializes the gradID field that is unique to the GradStudent class
  }

  public GradStudent(String name, int[] tests, String grade, int gradID) { // parameterized constructor
    super(name, tests, grade); // uses the parameterized constructor of the Student Class, must be used in first line if used
    this.gradID = gradID; // initializes the gradID field that is unique to the GradStudent class
  }

  public void computeGrade() {
    super.computeGrade(); // invokes computeGrade in the Student class
    if (getTestAverage() >= 90) // additional code not in the computeGrade method of the Student class
      setGrade("Pass with distinction");
  }

}
```

### Declaring Subclass Objects
- since a **GradStudent is-a Student**, the following declarations are legal:
```java
Student s = new Student(); // VALID
Student g = new GradStudent(); // VALID
```
- and the following declaration is NOT legal:
```java
GradStudent g = new Student(); // INVALID
```
- when you call a method e.g. `setGrade` that is present in both the **Student** and **GradStudent** classes, the following are legal:
```java
s.setGrade("Pass"); // VALID
g.setGrade("Pass"); // VALID
```
- however, if you call a method e.g. `getID` that is present in the **GradStudent** class but not in the **Student** class, it will NOT work
```java
s.getID(); // INVALID
```

### Polymorphism
- a method that has been **overridden** in at least one subclass is said to be **polymorphic**
- **polymorphism** is the mechanism of selecting the appropriate method for a particular object in a class hierarchy
- the correct method is chosen because, in Java, method calls are always determined by the type of the **actual object**, not the type of the **object reference**
- in Java, the selection of the correct method occurs during the **run-time execution of the program**

### Dynamic Binding (Late Binding) vs. Static Binding (Early Binding)
- **static binding** involves selecting the correct **overloaded** instance method to use at **compile time**, where the compiler determines the correct method to use by comparing their **signatures**
- **dynamic-bindng** is when the decision about which **overridden** instance method to call takes place during **run-time**
- basically, the **compiler** determines **if** a method can be called (i.e. is it legal?), while the **run-time environment** determines **how** it will be called (i.e. which overridden form should be used?)

### Type Compatibility (Downcasting)
```java
Student s = new GradStudent();
GradStudent g = new GradStudent();
int x = s.getID();  // causes a compile-time error
int y = g.getID();  // legal
```
- in the code above, although both `s` and `g` are `GradStudent` objects, `s` is of the type `Student`, and the `Student` class does not have the `getID()` method i.e. it is **not polymorphic**
- this means that in compile time, only the **nonprivate** methods of the **Student** class can be invoked on `s`
- the error above can be fixed by **casting** `s` to the correct type:
```java
int x = ((GradStudent) s).getID(); // this is possible since s is actually a GradStudent object
```
- casting a **superclass** to a **subclass** is called **downcasting**

### HOMEWORK
**Assignments**:
- read over **Activity 2** of the [Elevens Lab](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/elevens-lab-student-guide.pdf)
- based on what we did for the `Card.java`([solution](https://github.com/alyeffy/AP-CS-A_2018-2019/blob/master/Labs/Lab_1-Elevens/Solution/Card.java)) class in our first lab last lesson, complete the `isEmpty` and `size` **accessor methods**. HINT: You will need to use one of the methods from the AP Exam [Java Quick Reference](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/explore-ap/ap-computer-science-a-2014-java-quick-reference.pdf)

**Prep for Next Class**:
- review the lecture notes for lessons 1-3 as we will be working on some questions in class
