Once again, we are going over in more detail what we touched very briefly on in Lesson 02.
By using **control structures**, you can make statements of a program run in a non-sequential order, such as for **decision-making** or **iteration**.

### If, If-Else, and Nested If Statements

- An **if statement** is a conditional statement; it allows the program to execute a specific set of instructions if some certain (Boolean) condition (usually based on the program inputs) is met, and skipping those instructions otherwise.
- These are used when there is only **1 possible outcome** for the condition.

```java
if (hasAllInfinityStones) {
  snapFingers(); // executed if and only if above condition is met
}

if (hasAllInfinityStones)
  snapFingers(); // statement (syntactically valid if only 1 line of code)
```

- An **if-else statement** also provides an alternative route of control flow for when the condition is not met, so they are used when there are **2 possible outcomes** for the condition, causing a branch in the control flow.

```java
if (isHappy) {
  System.out.println('Monkey loves you!'); // executed if and only if above condition is met
} else {
  System.out.println('Monkey needs a hug.'); // executed otherwise
}

if (isHappy)
  System.out.println('Monkey loves you!'); // syntactically valid as above as if-clause is one line
else
  System.out.println('Monkey needs a hug.'); // syntactically valid as above as else-clause is one line
```

- There is also a short-form of the if-else statement using the **?** and **:** operators:
```java
if (chromosome[22] == "XX") {
  sex = "Female";
} else {
  sex = "Male";
}

sex = (chromosome[22] == "XX") ? "Female" : "Male"; // this is semantically equivalent to above
```

- A **nested if statement** is an if-statement within an if statement, usually used for **sequential conditions**, where the inner if statement's condition is only worth checking if the outer if statement's condition is met.

```java
if (wizard.getSchool() == "Hogwarts") { // 1st condition
  if (wizard.getGPA() >= 3.5) {// 2nd condition that is only checked if and only if 1st condition is met
    wizard.setHouse("Ravenclaw");
  }
}

if (wizard.getSchool() == "Hogwarts" && wizard.getGPA() >= 3.5) // due to Java's short-circuit evaluation, this is semantically equivalent to the above style
  wizard.setHouse("Ravenclaw");

```

- **Extended if statements** are for when there are multiple different paths that control can flow to.
```java
if (this.name = "Stark") {
  return "Winter Is Coming";
} else if (this.name = "Lannister") {
  return "Hear Me Roar";
} else if (this.name = "Targaryen") {
  return "Fire And Blood";
} else if (this.name = "Greyjoy") {
  return "We Do Not Sow";
} else if (this.name = "Baratheon") {
  return "Ours Is The Fury";
} else if (this.name = "Tyrell") {
  return "Growing Strong";
} else if (this.name = "Martell") {
  return "Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.";
} else if (this.name = "Tully") {
  return "Family. Duty. Honour";
} else {
  return "As High As Honour"; // this will be returned if this.name is anything other than the previous values tested
}

// code below is semantically equivalent to above
if (this.name = "Stark")
  return "Winter Is Coming";
else if (this.name = "Lannister")
  return "Hear Me Roar";
else if (this.name = "Targaryen")
  return "Fire And Blood";
else if (this.name = "Greyjoy")
  return "We Do Not Sow";
else if (this.name = "Baratheon")
  return "Ours Is The Fury";
else if (this.name = "Tyrell")
  return "Growing Strong";
else if (this.name = "Martell")
  return "Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.";
else if (this.name = "Tully")
  return "Family. Duty. Honour";
else
  return "As High As Honour";
}
```

- While using the one-line style without curly braces often looks neater and is more readable, be mindful of **indentation** to avoid creating **dangling else cases** when combining nested if statements with if-else statements.
- The else-clause will always get matched to the **nearest unpaired if statement**.

```java
public void TransferCourse(Course course) {
  if (course.isValid())
    if (course.getGrade() >= 4)
      course.setCreditsEarned(true);
      System.out.println("Course " + course.getCourseCode() + " transferred successfully.");
  else
    System.out.println("Course is not offered at this institution.");
}

```
- In the above example, if the course was valid but had a grade of 2, `Course is not offered at this institution.` in the else clause would be printed to the console, because the closest if statement to it is the inner one (whose condition is not met).
- Note that if the course was invalid in the first place, `Course is not offered at this institution.` would be printed correctly since the inner if statement will not be reached at all.

### Scopes
- The **scope** of a variable or method is the **region** in which that variable or method is **visible and can be accessed**.
- The instance variables, static variables, and methods or a specific class all belong to that class' scope, which extends from the opening brace `{` to the closing brace `}` of the class definition. This is known as **lexical scoping** or **static scoping**, is determined when the code is compiled, and is a convention used by many programming languages (instead of **dynamic scoping**).
- Within the class, all instance variables and methods are accessible and can be referred to simply by name (no need to call it as `ClassName.classMethod()`, just `classMethod()`)
- A **local variable** is defined inside a method or even a statement, and its scope extends from the point where it is declared to the **end of the code block** in which its declaration occurs.
- A **block** a section of code enclosed in a pair of braces `{}`, and control flow exits a block, the memory for a local variable is automatically recycled (i.e. variable no longer exists in memory).
- Local variables **take precedence** over instance variables with the **same name**, which is why using the same name can lead to ambiguity and errors and should generally be avoided

```java
public class Pokemon {

  public String name;

  // Constructor
  public Pokemon(String name) {
    this.name = name; // using the this keyword is necessary because the name of the data field and parameter are the same
  }

  // Constructor
  public Pokemon(String n) {
    name = n; // using the this keyword is not necessary here because the parameter and data field have different names
  }

  // Changes name of Pokemon instance
  public void setName(String name) {
    n = name; // n will only exist in memory until the end of the code block of this method
    name = n; // actual name of Pokemon object will not be changed because the default name used is the parameter
  }

  public String getName() {
    return n; // will cause an error because n does not exist as a variable/method in the Pokemon class
  }

} // anything outside of this brace has to call getName() as Pokemon.getName()
```

We did the following questions in class, and from your most recent MCQ question set:

1. Consider the following code segment.
```java
int num1 = 9;
int num2 = 5;
if (num1 > num2)
{
  System.out.print((num1 + num2) % num2);
}
else
{
  System.out.print((num1 - num2) % num2);
}
```
What is printed as a result of executing the code segment?
- (A) 0
- (B) 2
- (C) 4
- (D) 9
- (E) 14

2. Consider the following code segment.
```java
int value = initValue;
if (value > 10)
  if (value > 15)
    value = 0;
else
  value = 1;
System.out.println("value = " + value);
```
Under which of the conditions below will this code segment print `value = 1`?
- (A) initValue = 8;
- (B) initValue = 12;
- (C) initValue = 20;
- (D) Never. `value = 0` will always be printed.
- (E) Never. Code will not compile.

3. Rewrite the following code with the correct syntax:

```java
public class OhNo {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int a = 7,
    b = 42;
    minimum(a,b);
    if {smaller = a} {
      System.out.println("a is the smallest!");
    }
  }

  public static void minimum(int a, int b) {
    if (a < b) {
      int smaller = a;
    } else (a = b) {
      int smaller = b;
    }
    return int smaller;
  }
}
```
**HINT**: There are 7 errors.

4. Rewrite the following code to eliminate redundancy while still being semantically equivalent.
```java
if (x < 30) {
  a = 2;
  x++;
  System.out.println("Spongebob Squarepants! " + x);
} else {
  a = 2;
  System.out.println("Spongebob Squarepants! " + x);
}
```

---

**ANSWERS**:
1. C
2. B
3. The corrected code with explanations is as follows:
```java
public class OhNo {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int a = 7; // #1 - use a semicolon, not a comma
    int b = 42; // #2 - b is a new variable, so you need to specify the type
    int minimum(a,b); // #3 - when you call an accessor, save the value of something you want to use for later
    if (smaller = a) { // #4 - Boolean condition should be within brackets, not braces
      System.out.println("a is the smallest!");
    }
  }

  public static int minimum(int a, int b) { // #5 - void doesn't return anything!
    if (a < b) {
      int smaller = a;
    } else { // #6 - else clauses should not have a condition!
      int smaller = b;
    }
    return int smaller; // #7 - don't need to specify the type of an existing variable
  }
}
```
4. The idea here is to remove anything that would happen in either case. Always aim to avoid redundancy in your code!
```java
a = 2;
if (x < 30)
  x++;
System.out.println("Spongebob Squarepants! " + x);
```

### For Loops
- For loops are great for repeating a set of instructions a set number of times, especially over a collection of items
- As we know, the general form of the for loop is as follows:

```java
for (initialization; termination condition; update statement;) {
  // statements in the loop body
}
```

- It is important to note that the initialization of the **loop control variable (LCV)** occurs before the first iteration of the loop, the termination condition is tested **before the each of the next iteration** of the loop, and the update statement is performed at the **end of the loop body**.
- In other words, the code in the loop body of the following for loop will not be executed at all:

```java
for (i = 0; i == 0; i++;) {
  System.out.println("Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.");
}

// This is semantically equivalent to above as there is only one line in the loop body
for (i = 0; i == 0; i++;)
  System.out.println("Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.");

```

- The LCV should also not have its value changed **inside the loop body**
- The initializing and update statements can use **any valid constants, variables, or expressions**
- The scope of the LCV can be restricted to the loop body by combining its declaration with its initialization (e.g. by replacing `i = 0` in the initialization with `int i = 0`, so that i does not have to initialized before the loop, and only exists within the loop)

**Nested For Loops**
- Exactly what you think it is: A loop within a loop
- The **outer loop control variable (OLCV)** is used to control the outer loop, and the **inner loop control variable (ILCV)** is used to control the inner loop
- There is no limit to the number of times you can nest a series of loops, but with each additional level, the entire structure will take an exponentially longer time to complete (more on this in another topic)

```java
for (OLCV; termination using OLCV; update OLCV) {
  for (ILCV; termination using ILCV; update ILCV) {
    System.out.println("I'm Mr. Meseeks! Look at me!");
  }
}
```
- For the above code, assuming the inner loop will execute **x times**, and the outer loop will execute **y times**, the structure will take **xy** times to complete

**For-Each Loops**
- An enhanced type of for loop that is specialized for iterating over collections e.g. **arrays**
```java
for (SomeType element : collection) {
  // statements in the loop body to be executed for each element of some type in the collection
}
```
- These hide the index variable that is used with arrays
- They should be used for **accessing** elements, not replacing/removing them as you traverse along the collection
- What if there is a case when you want to exit the loop **before** the specified termination point? Use the `break` statement to break out of the loop!

### While Loops
- We know that these are very similar to for loops, but are more suitable to use when you **don't necessarily know how many iterations** are supposed to occur.
- The initialization must occur **before** the while loop is declared
- The termination condition is a boolean expression and is the **only thing in the while loop's brackets** `()`
- The update statement MUST occur within the loop body, and is usually best done at the **end of the loop body**
- The termination condition does not necessarily have to include the LCV (but it often does), but the update statement generally has to incorporate the LCV in some way

```java
int i = 0; // initialization
while (i < 10) { // termination condition
  // statements in the loop body to be executed if and only if the boolean expression is true
  i++; //
}
```

**Infinite Loops**
- The termination condition is really important! Using the wrong one could cause the loop to keep **iterating indefinitely**, since the LCV is never updated to the point where the termination condition is met.
- Infinite loops can happen to for loops, while loops, and even in recursion
- The following will cause infinite loops.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i--) {
  i++; // i is incremented by 1 (i == 1) and then is decremented by 1 (i == 0) at the end of the loop, so loop goes on FOREVER
}

int i = 0;
while (i == 0) {
  // do something FOREVER because i is never incremented
}
```

**Boundary Checking**
- A **boundary error** a.k.a. "off-by-one" error is an error where the loop is executed either one too many or too little times
- This concept will be tested many times on the AP Computer Science A Exam
- A good way to prevent this is to start the initialization with **0** e.g. `int i = 0;`, and the termination condition should be **one less** than the number of times you want the loop to run e.g. `i < max;` (loop will run `max` times) assuming i is incremented by 1 each time `i++;`
- Alternatively, if you prefer to start with `int i = 1` (not recommended for computer science!), the termination condition should be `i <= max;`, again assuming the update statement is `i++;`
