### Memory Allocation
The computer is composed of many different parts that are **functionally analogous** to different parts of the human body. In fact, prior to their invention, a "computer" was a type of job done by human beings (often women), in which their role was exactly the same: perform a series of **calculations/operations** based on a **process or a set of rules**. Below is a table that draws analogies between some parts of a computer and the human body.

| **Computer Part** | **Human Part** | **Function** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Casing | Skeleton | Holds all the vital parts in the right place and protects them from the environment |
| Central Processing Unit (CPU) | Brain | Processes instructions and performs arithmetic/logical operations |
| Power Supply | Heart | Provides energy to other parts |
| Memory | Memory | Stores information for long-term (Hard Drive) or short-term (Random Access Memory - RAM) |

For the AP Exam, we will be focusing specifically on **computer memory**, specifically, the part of computer memory that is used when a **program is executed** - the **RAM**. Computer memory exists as a hierarchy, where the type of memory at the top is the **fastest**, and therefore used for data that is **most frequently accessed**, but then also the **most expensive**, and so **smallest amount available** to the computer. The type of memory at the bottom then is the **slowest**, and so used for data that is **rarely accessed**, and thus, the **cheapest** and **most abundant** to the computer. This hierarchy can be envisioned as a pyramid, as seen below:

![image](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/caoppt-150426015255-conversion-gate01/95/the-memory-hierarchy-28-638.jpg?cb=1430013419)

Whenever you declare a variable (e.g. `int x = 5;`), you are telling the computer to set aside some of its memory to store the value `5` in a specific physical location in its memory. This location has an address, that 'houses' that value. Note that you are not deciding which exact address to use - that has been determined by your computer. The **identifier** `x` contains the **memory address** for the value `5`, such that whenever you make a call to it (e.g. `return x;`), you are asking the computer to retrieve the value stored at the memory address identified by x. If you want a new value to be stored at that memory address, you would also use the identifier to retrieve the correct memory address where `5` was stored and assign a new value to it (e.g. `x = 10;`). A simplified depiction of computer memory and their addresses is shown below:

| **Identifier** | **Memory Address** | **Value** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| x | 0000 | 5 |
| y | 0001 | 10 |
| a | 0010 | 1 |
| b | 0011 | 0 |

In the diagram above, the memory address `0001` refers to the specific space in the computer's memory that stores the value `10`, and is referred to be the identifier `y`.

### Primitive (Built-In) Data Types vs. Object Classes
- You may have noticed by now that pretty much **everything in Java is a class**, and any **class** you create is an extension (or **subclass**) of the **Object class** data structure (more on this in another topic)
- In fact, raw `.java` files (which are actually a type of plain text file) has to be converted into `.class` files by the **compiler in the JDK** before they can be executed
- **primitive types** and **object classes** are stored in memory differently, since they usually differ greatly in the amount of memory that will be needed to store them
- **primitive types** in the AP subset include the `int`, `double`, and `boolean` as discussed in a prior lesson, and **object classes** in the AP subset include `String` and `List`

- **Integer values** in Java are **stored exactly**, as a string of **bits**, where the `int` type uses **4 bytes (8 bits)** of memory, one of which stores the **sign** of the integer (**0 for positive, 1 for negative**)

| **sign** | 2<sup>6 | 2<sup>5 | 2<sup>4 | 2<sup>3 | 2<sup>2 | 2<sup>1 | 2<sup>0 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |

- This means that the **largest possible positive integer** that can be stored is **2<sup>31</sup>-1**, and the **smallest possible negative integer** that can be stored is **-2<sup>31</sup>**
- In general, an **n-bit** integer uses **n/8** bytes of storage, and stores integers from **-2<sup>n-1</sup>** to **2<sup>n-1</sup>-1**
- Two Java constants you should know are `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, which holds the maximum value an `int` can hold: **2<sup>31</sup>-1**; and `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, which holds the minimum value an `int` can hold: **-2<sup>31</sup>**
- [FUN FACT](https://edition.cnn.com/2014/12/03/showbiz/gangnam-style-youtube/index.html): In December 2014, [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) said that [PSY's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psy) music video [Gangnam Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0) exceeded the 32-bit integer limit [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) view count, so YouTube had to upgrade the counter to a 64-bit integer. As of Aug 6 2018, Gangnam Style is the YouTube video with the 5th highest view count ([Despacito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk) takes the top spot)

- **Floating-point** numbers (e.g. `double`, which uses **8 bytes**) are stored in two parts: a **mantissa** which specifies the **digits** of the number, and an **exponent**
- for a `double` which is a **double-precision** number, the **mantissa** typically uses **52 bits**, while the **exponent** uses **11 bits**, and **1 bit** is also used for the **sign**
- the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** represents the number using scientific notation: **2 &ast; matissa &ast; 2<sup>exponent</sup>**
- when floating-point numbers are **converted to binary**, most **cannot be represented exactly**, leading to **round-off error**, which are **compounded by arithmetic operations** e.g. `0.1*26` is not equivalent to `0.1+0.1+...+0.1` (26 terms), and these errors **will not throw exceptions** in Java
- as said in an earlier lesson, you should be aware that if a performing an operation gives an **undefined result** e.g. taking the square root of a negative number or `0.0` divided by `0.0`, Java expresses this as `NaN` (not a number), and an operation that gives an **infinitely small/large number** (e.g. division by zero) will produce `-Infinity`/`Infinity` in Java

- **Object classes** are stored in **two parts in separate locations**: their **reference variable** and the **object itself (along with instance variables/methods etc.)**. We will cover more on this in another topic.

### What is JVM vs. JRE vs. JDK/SDK vs. IDE ???
- The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** enables a computer to run **Java programs**, and programs in other languages that have been compiled to **Java bytecode**. The JVM is also responsible for Java's **automatic memory management (garbage collection)**.
- The JVM is a part of the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**, which is a software that **ensures that the JVM has everything it needs** to actually run the program.
- Any software needs to be executed, and needs an **environment in which it can be executed**.
- Whenever a Java program is executed, the class loader in the **JRE** loads **class files, dependencies (e.g. libraries)** and other program files/system resources, and ensures that there is **access to memory**, so that the Java program can be executed.
- This is preferable to directly using the **Operating System (OS)** as the runtime environment.
- Think of the JRE as a layer of software above the OS hardware, that is able **access the different required services** for the Java program to execute, in the **correct way based on the OS** the program is being run from.
- This allows programmers to just **write the program once**, and it can be **run on virtually any OS**.
- The JRE then is basically a **meta-OS** for Java programs; it creates a consistent platform (the JVM) for running Java applications that **abstracts the underlying OS**.
- The JRE is part of the **Java Development Kit (JDK)** you downloaded, which is a set of tools (i.e. a Software Development Kit (SDK)) specifically for **developing Java software**, and running the software is an intrinsic part of that process.
- The JDK includes the **compiler** that compiles code for the JVM to run, and the **Java class libraries** loaded by the JRE.
- An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** like the **Eclipse** software you downloaded is an interface for programmers to use the SDK tools, that usually makes it a lot easier to write programs efficiently. IDEs e.g. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), are essentially very advanced code editors (often specialized for a specific language), but with the SDK for each language, you can also use simpler editors e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/) (my personal favourite), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), and even the command line to write programs in many different languages (since they are not specialized for a specific language)! The diagram below summarizes the relationships between all these different terms and their functions:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10457017/48261287-6c564d80-e3d3-11e8-836c-e178c3e9c11a.png)

### Operators and Binary Conversion
- We covered this briefly in an earlier lesson, but for this class, we did a lot of practice questions involving them. Questions on this will usually appear as MCQ questions on the exam.
- When approaching these questions, it is important to be familiar with the **order of precedence** for operations, and that any operations that mix the `double` and `int` types have to be carefully done (e.g. using **casting** appropriately), as converting a `double` to an `int` will **truncate** the number (e.g. `(int) 3.0 / 4` will give `0`)

The following is an easy way to convert **decimal to binary/octal/hexadecimal**:

1. Take the original number **n<sub>10</sub>**, and divide it by **2** or **8** or **16** depending on whether you are converting it to **bin/oct/hex**.
2. From that operation, place the **remainder** as the **rightmost** (i.e. **2<sup>0</sup>** or **8<sup>0</sup>** or **16<sup>0</sup>**) digit of the final **bin/oct/hex** number.
3. If **quotient > 0**, then that **divide the quotient** again by the same number as earlier, and place this **new remainder** to the **left** of the **previous remainder** (i.e. the **2<sup>1</sup>** or **8<sup>1</sup>** or **16<sup>1</sup>** digit of the final **bin/oct/hex** number).
4. Keep repeating step 3 until **quotient = 0**, and the **final answer** is that string of remainders.

**Convert 1792<sub>10</sub> to Binary:**

| **Number<sub>10</sub>** | **Operation** | **Quotient** | **Remainder (0-1)** | **Result<sub>2</sub>** |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1792 | / 2 | 896 | **0** | **0** |
| 896 | / 2 | 448 | **0** | **0**0 |
| 448 | / 2 | 224 | **0** | **0**00 |
| 224 | / 2 | 112 | **0** | **0**000 |
| 112 | / 2 | 56 | **0** | **0**0000 |
| 56 | / 2 | 28 | **0** | **0**00000 |
| 28 | / 2 | 14 | **0** | **0**000000 |
| 14 | / 2 | 7 | **0** | **0**0000000 |
| 7 | / 2 | 3 | **1** | **1**00000000 |
| 3 | / 2 | 1 | **1** | **1**100000000 |
| 1 | / 2 | 0 | **1** | **1**1100000000 |

Final Answer: **11100000000<sub>2</sub>**

**Convert 1792<sub>10</sub> to Octal:**

| **Number<sub>10</sub>** | **Operation** | **Quotient** | **Remainder (0-7)** | **Result<sub>8</sub>** |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1792 | / 8 | 224 | **0** | **0** |
| 224 | / 8 | 28 | **0** | **0**0 |
| 28 | / 8 | 3 | **4** | **4**00 |
| 3 | / 8 | 0 | **3** | **3**400 |

Final Answer: **3400<sub>8</sub>**

**Convert 1792<sub>10</sub> to Hexadecimal:**

| **Number<sub>10</sub>** | **Operation** | **Quotient** | **Remainder (0-F)** | **Result<sub>16</sub>** |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1792 | / 16 | 112 | **0** | **0** |
| 112 | / 16 | 7 | **0** | **0**0 |
| 7| / 16 | 0 | **7** | **7**00 |

Final Answer: **700<sub>16</sub>**

For converting **smaller decimal numbers to binary**, it might be faster to just **count using your hand**. Close your left hand into a face with your fingers facing you. Each finger represents a bit, and since you have 5 fingers, you will be able to count in binary up to **2<sup>5</sup>-1** i.e. **31**. Each finger on your hand can have the value **1** (finger is raised), or **0** (finger is curled), and your leftmost finger (**thumb**) represents the **2<sup>4</sup>** bit, and your rightmost finger (**little finger**) represents the **2<sup>0</sup>** bit as below:

| FINGER | THUMB | INDEX | MIDDLE | RING | LITTLE |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Number<sub>10</sub>** | **2<sup>4</sup> = 16** | **2<sup>3</sup> = 8** | **2<sup>2</sup> = 4** | **2<sup>1</sup> = 2** |  **2<sup>0</sup> = 1** |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 4 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 6 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 7 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 9 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 10 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

- The fingers that are raised should **add up to the decimal number** you are converting (e.g. raising the **middle** finger (**2<sup>2</sup> = 4**) and the **little** finger (**2<sup>0</sup> = 1**) should add up to **5** as shown above.
- **FUN FACT**: if you're trying this, you should probably avoid showing **4 in binary** to someone else lol

We did the following questions in class, and from your most recent MCQ question set:

1. Convert 93 base 10 to base 16.
- (A) A9
- (B) 93
- (C) 5D
- (D) 139
- (E) 147

**HINT**: If you divide 93 by 16, you get a quotient of 5, and a remainder of 13 (What is 13 in hex?).

- (A) 115
- (B) 175
- (C) 250
- (D) 400

### Truth Tables, Short-Circuit Evaluation, Negations, and DeMorgan's Law
- We covered this briefly in an earlier lesson, but for this class, we did a lot of practice questions involving them. Questions on this will usually appear as MCQ questions on the exam and in the form of **compound conditionals**
- When approaching these questions, it is useful to use **Truth Tables**, **Short-Circuit Evaluation**, and **DeMorgan's Law**

**Truth Tables**

- Truth tables are really useful for solving compound conditional evaluations, especially ones where you need to figure out WHEN the expression evaluation will produce true (i.e. **what inputs leads to an output of true**), as you can write down the result for each possible outcome.
- The general rule of thumb is that there are **2<sup>n</sup>** possible outcomes for **n inputs**. The truth table below has 4 possible outcomes for inputs A & B:

| **A** | **B** | **A && B** | **A \\|\\| B** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| T | T | T | T |
| T | F | F | T |
| F | T | F | T |
| F | F | F | F |

- You may also find it easier to distinguish results by using `0` to represent `false` and `1` to represent `true`:

| **A** | **B** | **A && B** | **A \\|\\| B** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

**Short-Circuit Evaluation**

- Recall that in one of our labs involving [Activity 1](http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/elevens-lab-student-guide.pdf) of the [Elevens Lab](https://github.com/alyeffy/AP-CS-A_2018-2019/blob/master/Labs/Lab_1-Elevens/Solution/Card.java), when we were implementing the `compareCard` method, we used the `&&` operator rather than **nested if statements**:

```java
public boolean compareCard(Card otherCard) {
  if (this.rank == otherCard.getRank() && this.suit == otherCard.getSuit() && this.pointValue == otherCard.getPointValue())
    return true;
  return false;
}

public boolean compareCard(Card otherCard) {
  if (this.rank == otherCard.getRank())
    if (this.suit == otherCard.getSuit())
      if (this.pointValue == otherCard.getPointValue())
        return true;
  return false;
}
```

- The above two methods are equivalent, but in some languages, the `&&` operator does not exist, so the **nested if statement** method would've been the only option.
- At first, it seems like the nested if statement option is more efficient, since we know **right away** that two Card objects are **not the same** of their **ranks are different**, meaning that the **other 2 if statements won't be executed**.
- However, Java uses **short-circuit evaluation** to speed up the evaluation of compound conditionals.
- The if condition in the first method will be evaluated from left to right as normal, so the `this.rank == otherCard.getRank()` will return `false`, and as soon as the `&&` operator is read, that will **only return true if the conditions it is between are both true**, Java knows that the entire condition will not be met **right away because the first part is already false**, so the next two parts will not even be evaluated as well.
- Similarly, if the `&&` operators in that condition were replaced with `||` operators instead, which **only ever return false when the conditions they are between are false**, and the first part returned `true`, then Java knows **right away that the condition will be met because the first part is already true**.
- Being aware of this can help with solving compound conditional boolean evaluation questions on the exam more efficiently.

**Negations**

- Negations/contradictions are opposites. The `!` (NOT) symbol can be used to return negations of boolean operators, as shown below:

| **Operator with !** | **Equivalent Result** |
| :---: | :---: |
| !true  | false |
| !false | true |
| !(a != 2) | a == 2 |
| !(a == 5) | a != 5 |
| !(b <= 4) | b > 4 |
| !(b < 3) | b >= 3 |
| !(c > 1) | c <= 1 |
| !(c >= 0) | c < 0 |

**DeMorgan's Law**

- This law also helps with complex compound conditionals. Applying **DeMorgan's Law** to the following compound conditionals produces these results:

| **Compound Conditional** | **Result after applying DeMorgan's Law** |
| :---: | :---: |
| !(a && b) | !a \\|\\| !b |
| !(a \\|\\| b) | !a && !b |

---

We did the following questions in class, and from your most recent MCQ question set:

1. Assume that a, b, and c have been declared and initialized with `int` values. The expression `!(a > b || b <= c)` is equivalent to which of the following?
- (A) `a > b && b <= c`
- (B) `a <= b || b > c`
- (C) `a <= b && b > c`
- (D) `a < b || b >= c`
- (E) `a < b && b >= c`

**HINT**: Use negations and DeMorgan's Law!

2. Assume that x, y, and z have been declared as follows:
```java
boolean x = true;
boolean y = false;
boolean z = true;
```
Which of the following expressions evaluates to true?
- (A) `x && y && z`
- (B) `x && y || z && y`
- (C) `!(x && y) || z`
- (D) `!(x || y) && z`
- (E) `x && y || !z`

**HINT**: Use short-circuit evaluation, DeMorgan's Law, and a truth table!

3. A cafeteria orders a machine that dispenses either coffee, tea, or milk. Each drink has a designated button for it (c, t, or m), and only 1 type of drink may be dispensed at each time. Complete the truth table below to show all 8 possible outcomes, where 0 means a button is not pressed, and 1 means a button is pressed, and x is the result. The first example has been done for you. How many outcomes result in a drink being dispensed?

| c | t | m | **x** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | **0** |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

- These outcomes can be expressed as the boolean expression: `(c && !(t || m)) || (t && !(c || m)) || (m && !(c || m))`. Write a boolean expression that is equivalent to it.

4. A country has constructed a working defensive missile launching turret that is controlled by their Security Council. The council consists of 4 members: the President, Vice-President, and Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force. The missile system should only activated using a device where each council member has to press a button, and a missile should only be launched if the President and at least one other council member presses their respective buttons. Construct a truth table showing all the possible outcomes, and state how many result in the missile being launched. Write the simplest possible boolean expression that will produce these outcomes.

5. An elevator for a two-floor building has a first-floor button, a second-floor button, and a present-floor indicator. The elevator will only move to the other floor if and only if that floor's button is pressed, it is not currently on that floor, and the button of the current floor is not pressed. Using a truth table, show all the possible outcomes. How many of the possible outcomes result in the elevator moving? What boolean expression in its simplest form results in these outcomes?

6. Most calculators, digital clocks, and digital watches use the 'seven segment display' format. In the diagram below, there are 7 segments that can be lit in different combinations to form the digits 0 to 9. e.g. 1 is indicated by lighting up segments b and d. How many different ways are there to light up the display? Complete the truth table below to show which segments need to lit up to display each digit (i.e. 10 outcomes). Then based on the 10 outcomes, write a boolean expression in the simplest form for each digit in the same form as for 1 earlier. e.g. expressing the output of 1 as a boolean expression would be: `b && d`.
