### The Object Class
- Any Class in Java, whether built-in, imported, or created by someone, automatically extends the `Object` class, which is built into Java
- As every instantiation of a Class is an Object, and any class is a data abstraction of 'real-life' structures, think of the `Object` class as the superclass of the universe. It is at the top of the class hierarchy; the direct or indirect superclass of every other class.
- As there are many methods in the `Object` class, and the `Object` class is **not an abstract class**, all of its methods have implementations
- This means that any other class will inherit the `Object` class' methods, so these methods should be overidden in any class where the default implementation is unsuitable.
- The methods of the `Object` class that you need to be aware of for the AP exam are: `toString` and `equals`

**toString**
- `public String toString()`
- This method returns a version of your object in String form
- By default, calling the `toString` method on a Class object, will result in a String consisting of the class name and the memory address where the Object is stored e.g. `Pokemon@fea485c4`
- This might not necessarily be useful, so it is best practice to override the toString method for your own classes (for the sake of debugging)
- The **only** class that does not have a `toString` method, are any `Array` objects; you have to traverse the array and print each element

**equals**
- `public boolean equals(Object other)`
- This method returns true if the Object that the method is called on (e.g. `d1`) is equal to the object in the method's parameter (e.g. `d2`). The two objects being compared should be of the same type.
- How is equality defined in this case? By default, an Object is considered equal to another Object if they share the **same memory address**.
- This means that even if two different Objects share the exact **same values in their fields**, if they are **stored in different areas** of the computer's memory, the default `equals` function will not produce `true`. This means that in the following code, `d1.equals(d2)` returns `true`, but `d1.equals(d3)` returns `false`.
- If you would like the `equals` function to instead compare the fields of both objects and produce true if the values of all the corresponding fields are the same, you would have to **override the default** `equals` function.

```java
Date d1 = new Date("January", 14, 2001);
Date d2 = d1;
Date d3 = new Date("January", 14 2001);
```

- Why is this the case? Any `Object` class is **not a primitive value**, and not stored exactly, but in 2 parts stored separately: the **reference variable**, and the **actual object**.
- The **reference variable** (i.e. `d1`, `d2`, & `d3` in this case) contains the **memory address** determined by the `new` keyword, and this address is the area in memory where the **actual object** is stored.
- In other words, in the code above, `d1` and `d2` refer to the exact **same object** i.e. they store the **same memory address** of that object (this is known as **aliasing**), but `d3` stores the memory address of a **different object of the same values in a different location**. The diagram below illustrates this:

### The String Class
- A `String` object is a sequence of characters, and any **string literals** (0  or more characters, including escape sequences, surround by double quotes) are implementations of this class.
- String objects are **immutable**, meaning that there are no methods to change them after they've been constructed, meaning that if you attempt to mutate (change) an existing String that was previously declared, you would actually be creating a new String (and the previous one would be recycled).

```java
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = s1; // Instead of a new String object being created, also with the value "Hello", s1 and s2 will both hold the same memory address where the String "Hello" is located (Java will check if the String exists, so as to conserve memory)
s1 = "Goodbye"; // This creates a new String "Goodbye" in a different location, which s1 now points to
System.out.println(s1); // prints "Goodbye" as expected
System.out.println(s2); // prints "Hello", since s2 is still referring to "Hello" so it was not discarded
```

![]()

- String objects are unusual in that they can be initialized like a primitive type, even though they are not.
```java
// The following statements are equivalent to each other
String s = "abc";
String s = new String("abc");
// Since strings are immutable, the following statements:
String s = "Jane";
s = "Sally";
// are equivalent to the following statements:
String s = new String("Jane");
s = new String("Sally"); // The "Jane" String will now be discarded

// You can even initialize a null String
String s1 = null;
String s2 = new String();
```

- Note that a **null String is not the same as an empty String**. A null String has **no value**, **no length**, and **does not hold an address** of a String object. Calling a String method on a null String would throw a **NullPointerException** because the String object does not exist.
- An empty String has a **value of ""**, a **length of 0**, and **an address**. You CAN call String methods on it since it **does exist in memory**.

**String Concatenation**
- As you know, String objects can be appended together using the `+` operator (e.g. `"ha" + "ha"` becomes `"haha"`), and due to **promotion**, it will automatically convert other objects invoked with a String and the concatenation operator to String objects using the `toString` method (e.g. `"High "+ 5` becomes `"High 5"`).
- It is important to note that **at least one** of the items you are concatenating is already of `String` type. See the examples below:

```java
int x = 1, y =2;
String sum = x + y; // This will cause an error because neither x or y are Strings to begin with

Date d1 = new Date(1, 16, 2011);
Date d2 = new Date(2, 10, 2011);
String s = "My dog's birthday is " + d1; // This is valid, Date's toString method produces 1/16/2011

String s1 = d1 + d2 // This is not valid because neither Dates are Strings
String s2 = d1.toString() + d2.toString(); // This is the correct way to get the intended result of the above line
```

![]()

**String Comparison**
- DO NOT USE THE `==` OPERATOR TO COMPARE STRINGS - This only tests if the two Strings have the **same reference**, and will not always give the intended result!

```java
String s1 = "oh no";
String s2 = "oh no";
if (s == t) // This will return true even though it appears that s1 and s1 are different references. But they are the same; remember that Java makes only one String object for equivalent String literals. However, if I do the following:
String s2 = new String("oh no");
if (s == t) // Now this returns false because the use of the new keyword creates a new object, and s1 and s2 are actually different references in this case. This is why you should not use the == operator for comparing Strings!

```

- Instead, use the `equals` method: `string1.equals(string2)`, which returns `true` if 2 Strings are identical, and `false` otherwise.
- The `compareTo(String otherString)` method also exists, gives more information other than the Strings being equal.
- For example, when you call `string1.compareTo(string2)`, it can return 3 types of values:

| **Value** | **Meaning** |
| :---: | :---: |
| **< 0** | `string1` **precedes** `string2` in the dictionary |
| **> 0** | `string1` **follows** `string2` in the dictionary |
| **== 0** | `string1` and `string2` are **identical** |

- Remember that Java is **case-sensitive**. If `s1 = "Haha"` and `s2 = "haha"`, `s1.equals(s2)` returns `false.` This is because characters are compared according to their position in the [ASCII chart]().
- For the exam, you need to know that **all digits precede all uppercase letters, which precede all lowercase letters**, i.e. when it comes to ASCII values, **digits < uppercase letters < lowercase letters**.
- These methods do a **character-by-character** comparison of the Strings in corresponding positions, meaning that every character of one String must be of the same ASCII value and in the same position of the corresponding character in the other String.
- If at any point along the way there is a mismatch, **short-circuit evaluation** will occur.

```java
String s1 = "BAT", s2 = "BATMAN", s3 = "bat";
s1.compareTo(s2) < 0 // true, s1 terminates first
s1.compareTo(s3) > 0 // false, "B" comes before "b"
```

- The `String` class has many other methods, and in addition to the **constructors**, **comparison methods**, and **concatenation operator**, for the exam, you should know the following (which are provided on your AP exam Quick Reference):
- `int length()`: returns the length of this String
- `String substring(int from)`: Returns a new String that is a substring of the original String, starting from the `from` index, all the way **up to the end** of the String. If the value of `from` is **negative** or **larger than the length** of the String, an **IndexOutOfBoundsException** will be thrown.
- `String substring(int from, int to)`: Returns a new String that is a substring of the original String, starting from the `from` index, all the way up to the `to-1` index. `from` is the index as the **character you want**, all the way up to `to`, the **character you don't want**. This throws a `StringIndexOutOfBounds` exception if `from < 0`, `to > length`, or `from > to`.
- `int indexOf(String str)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of `str` within this String. If `str` is not a substring of the String, `-1` is returned. The method throws a `NullPointerException` if `str` is `null`.

- Although these methods are provided in the quick reference, it is useful to be aware of the tools at your disposal so you can quickly solve questions; the reference is best used to check the input/output types and values.
- **Off-by-one** errors are easy to make with these String methods. Remember that String indices always begin with 0. Observe the results of calling these methods on the String: `String s = "ice cream";`

| **String s** | i | c | e | | c | r | e | a | m |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Index** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |

```java
String s = "ice cream";
s.length(); // returns 9
s.substring(3); // returns " cream"
s.substring(1,6); // returns "ce cr"
s.indexOf("cr"); // returns 4
```

### Wrapper Classes
- A **wrapper** class takes either an existing object or a value of primitive type, and "wraps" it in an Object, providing a new set of methods for that type. The point of this IS to extend capabilities for the wrapped type.
- It can be used in generic Java methods that require objects as parameters.
- It can be used in Java container classes that require the items to be objects.
- The wrapper class allows:
1. Construction of an object from a single value (wrapping the primitive in a wrapper object).
2. Retrieval of the primitive value (unwrapping from the wrapper object).
- Java provides a wrapper class for each of its primitive types, and you only need to know about the `Integer` and `Double` classes for the AP exam.

**The Integer Class**
- This wraps a value of type `int` in an object of type `Integer`, that contains just one instance variable of type `int` i.e. The `Integer` class has just one field, that is of the type `int`, that contains the wrapped value.
- There are also methods within the `Integer` class that you need to know. Imagine it declared this way:

```java
public class Integer {

  public int value; // wrapped int value

  // Constructor that wraps the int value into an Integer object i.e. wrapping
  public Integer(int value) {
    this.value = value;
  }

  // NOT PROVIDED ON AP EXAM QUICK REFERENCE
  // Returns 0 if the value of this Integer object is == the value of other (also an Integer object),
  // returns a negative integer if its value < that of other, or
  // returns a positive integer if its value > that of other.
  public int compareTo(Integer other) {

  }

  // Returns the value of this Integer object as an int i.e. unwrapping
  public int intValue() {
    return this.value;
  }

  // NOT PROVIDED ON AP EXAM QUICK REFERENCE, DOES NOT OVERRIDE THE equals METHOD IN THE Object CLASS
  // Returns true if and only if this Integer object has the same int value as obj
  public boolean equals(Object obj) {

  }

  // NOT PROVIDED ON AP EXAM QUICK REFERENCE, OVERRIDES THE equals METHOD IN THE Object CLASS.
  // Returns a String representing the value of this Integer.
  public String toString() {

  }

  // ... other methods in the Integer class that you do not need to know for the exam.
}

// The following are examples to demonstrate the above Integer methods:
Integer intObj = new Integer(7); // wraps 7 in Integer object
int j = intObj.intValue();       // unwraps 7 from Integer object

System.out.println("Integer value is " + intObj); // calls toString for intObj
// Console output: Integer value is 7

Object object = new Integer(4); // Integer is a subclass of Object

Integer intObj2 = newInteger(1);
int k = intObj2.intValue();

if (intObj.equals(intObj2)) // evaluates to false
if (intObj.intValue == intObj2.intValue()) // evaluates to false

if (k.equals(j)) // ERROR: k and j are not objects
if ((intObj.intValue()).compareTo(intObj2.intValue())) // ERROR: can't use compareTo on primitive types

if (intObj.compareTo(object) < 0) // ERROR: Cast object as Integer first
if (intObj.compareTo((Integer) object)) // Correct

if (object.compareTo(intObj) < 0) // ERROR: No compareTo in Object
if (((Integer) object).compareTo(intObj) < 0) // Correct

```
- `Integer` objects are also **immutable**; there are no mutator methods in their class.
- Note that the `Integer.MAX_VALUE` and `Integer.MIN_VALUE` constants belong to this `Integer` class.

**The Double Class**
- This wraps a value of type `double` in an object of type `Double`, that contains just one instance variable of type `double` i.e. The `Double` class has just one field, that is of the type `double`, that contains the wrapped value.
- There are also methods within the `Double` class that you need to know. Imagine it declared this way:

```java
public class Double {

  public double value; // wrapped double value

  // Constructor that wraps the double value into a Double object i.e. wrapping
  public Double(double value) {
    this.value = value;
  }

  // Returns the value of this Double object as a double i.e. unwrapping
  public double doubleValue() {
    return this.value;
  }

  // NOT PROVIDED ON AP EXAM QUICK REFERENCE
  // Returns 0 if the value of this Double object is == the value of other (also an Double object),
  // returns a negative integer if its value < that of other, or
  // returns a positive integer if its value > that of other.
  public int compareTo(Double other) {

  }

  // NOT PROVIDED ON AP EXAM QUICK REFERENCE, DOES NOT OVERRIDE THE equals METHOD IN THE Object CLASS
  // Returns true if and only if this Double object has the same double value as obj
  public boolean equals(Object obj) {

  }

  // NOT PROVIDED ON AP EXAM QUICK REFERENCE, OVERRIDES THE equals METHOD IN THE Object CLASS.
  // Returns a String representing the value of this Double.
  public String toString() {

  }

}

// The following are examples to demonstrate the above Integer methods:
Double dObj = new Double(1.5);  // wraps 1.5 in Double object
double d = dObj.doubleValue();  // unwraps 1.5 from Double object

Object object = new Double(7.11); // Double is a subclass of Object
int intObj = new Integer(4);

if (dObj.compareTo(object) > 0) // ERROR: Cast object to Double first
if (dObj.compareTo((Double) object) > 0) // Correct

if (dObj.compareTo(intObj) > 0) // ERROR: Cannot compare Integer object to Double object
```

- `Double` objects are also **immutable**; there are no mutator methods in their class.

**Comparing double values The Correct Way**
- As we've mentioned before, using the `==` operator to compare doubles can be **risky due to rounding errors** that might compound after several operations are executed on the values.
- So the right way to compare if two doubles are equal is to use a **tolerance**, that the programmer defines based on the program.
- If the **absolute difference** between two double values is **less than or equal to the tolerance**, we define that the two doubles are **close enough to be considered equal**.

```java
double n1 = 4.0;
double n2 = 3.99999;
double tolerance = 0.0001;
boolean closeEnough = Math.abs(n1 - n2) <= tolerance;
// Since | n1 - n2 | = 0.00001, which is less than 0.0001, according to our defined tolerance, n1 is equal to n2
```

### The Math Class
- This class implements standard mathematical functions e.g. absolute value, square root, trigonometric functions, the log function, the power function etc., as well as mathematical constants such as **\pi** and **\mathrm{e}**, that are extremely useful in programming.
- Unlike other classes in the AP Computer Science subset, the Math class is special in that it contains **only static methods**, meaning that you **do not have to create a Math object from the Math class to use the Math methods**.
- You just need to use the class name followed by the dot operator and then the method name each time you want to use a method (`Math.methodName()`).
- The functions you should know for the AP exam (all of which are provided on the AP Exam Quick Reference) are:
- `static int abs(int x)`: Returns the absolute value of integer x
- `static double abs(double x)`: Returns the absolute value of real number x
- `static double pow(double base, double exp)`: Returns base<sup>exp</sup>. Assumes base > 0, or base = 0 and exp > 0, or base < 0 and exp is an integer.
- `static double sqrt(double x)`: Returns \sqrt{x}, where x >= 0
- `static double random()`: Returns a random number r, where 0.0 <= r < 1.0
- The range of the `random()` function can be scaled and shifted according to your needs:

```java
// The general rule for producing a random real value x in the range lowValue <= x < highValue is:
double x = (highValue - lowValue) * Math.random() + lowValue;

double x = 5 * Math.random();             // Produces a random real value x in the range 0.0 <= x < 5.0
double x = Math.random() + 3;             // Produces a random real value x in the range 3.0 <= x < 4.0
double x = 2 * Math.random() + 4          // Produces a random real value x in the range 4.0 <= x < 6.0

// You can also produce integers by casting the values to int
int n = (int) (Math.random() * 20) + 5;   // Produces a random integer value n from 5 to 24, inclusive
int n = (int) (Math.random() * 32 - 23);  // Produces a random integer value n from -23 to 8, inclusive

```
