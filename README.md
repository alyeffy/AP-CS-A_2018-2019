## [Course Overview](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-overview.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a)
### Administrative Information
- **Instructor**: [Alyssa Fegen](http://www.alyssafegen.com), BSc. Combined Major - Computer Science & Microbiology
- **Contact**: [Email](mailto:alyssafegen@alumni.ubc.ca)
- **Location**: [Elite Educational Institute](http://www.eliteprep.ca/?lang=en) - Richmond Campus (5560-8181 Cambie Rd, Richmond, BC V6X 3X9)
- **Class Time**: Tuesdays, 15:45 - 17:45 (**2 hours a week**, **25 Classes Total** i.e. **50 hours of in-class instruction time**)
### Teaching Style
Classes are modeled after university-style CS courses and will vary, but generally have one or a mix of the following structures:
- **Lecture and class discussion** on new concepts and syntax from the current topic
- **Collaborative exercises/examples/problems** involving the whole class to work together to create a solution, usually involving coding (on paper or on a laptop)
- **Individual/collaborated free time** to work on the current assignment/lab with supervision

BEFORE CLASS:
- Readings and/or videos may be assigned to students to read/watch prior to the next class to be prepared. **Please take a look at the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/alyeffy/AP-CS-A_2018-2019/issues) regularly** to find out what you need to prepare.
- **Collect any printouts/worksheets for class from my pigeonhole when you arrive**. Readings will be distributed in topic bundles prior to the beginning of the next topic.
- **If you need to bring a laptop to the next class, I will announce it in the issues** before the next class

AFTER CLASS:
- **Working together on assignments/labs is allowed**, but directly **copying code** from each other or plagiarizing code from the web **is not**. **Assignments/labs will be submitted on GitHub** so that submissions can be tracked. GitHub issues will be used to delegate these assignments and labs and establish their deadlines.
- Students may **seek assistance** from me or other classmates for assignments/labs **via GitHub**. **I will allot 30-60 minutes a weekday addressing any questions**. For information on formatting your comments, refer to this [GitHub markdown cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).
- **Email communication should be reserved for only very URGENT assignment/lab/exam-related questions, administrative issues** (e.g. unable to attend/late to class) or other clarifications. I am unlikely to share my cellphone number with students.

ASSESSMENT:
- **Progress will be monitored using these assignments and labs**. If time permits, I may assign a **coding project** for students to work on over the spring break, and **online tests/quizzes** at the end of each topic.
- I will try my best to make sure that the **last class before the exam will be a review and Q + A session** with a **mock exam** for practice and going through the answers together.

## [Course Description](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-course-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-a)

## [The AP Exam](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam?course=ap-computer-science-a)
**NOTE**: While the exam determines your final grade, the course MUST include **at least 20 hours of hands-on lab experiences**. Details on these labs can be found in the class schedule/topic outline.
- **DATE**:       Friday, 17 May 2019
- **TIME**:       12:00 - 15:00
- **DURATION**:   3 Hours
- **LOCATION**:   TBD

Registration information will be available shortly.

### Exam Format
- **Section I**: 40 Multiple Choice Questions | 1 H : 30 Min | 50% of Final Score
- **Section II**: 4 Free Response Questions | 1 H : 30 Min | 50% of Final Score

### Exam Scoring
| Score | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | Extremely well qualified |
| 4 | Well qualified |
| 3 | Qualified |
| 2 | Possibly qualified |
| 1 | No recommendation |

Depending on the university you are intending to apply to, **your exam score will determine if you are allowed to receive credits** for corresponding Computer Science courses (and possibly the grade as well).

## [Resources](https://github.com/alyeffy/AP-CS-A_2018-2019/tree/master/Resources)
- [Java Quick Reference](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/explore-ap/ap-computer-science-a-2014-java-quick-reference.pdf) - **IMPORTANT**, provided in your AP exam booklet
- [AP Java Subset](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-computer-science-a-java-subset.pdf) - not included in exam booklet but all code in the **AP exam is consistent with this subset**
- [Javadocs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/overview-summary.html) - detailed useful **specifications of the entire Java 7 API**
- [Free Online Java Programming Textbook](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/) - great for beginners
- [Popular Java book](https://www.amazon.com/Java-How-Program-8th-Edition/dp/0136053068) - just for your information, absolutely not necessary for this course
- [AP Computer Science Study Guide](https://ap-computer-science-guide.github.io/) - good summary but also contains extra information not in the AP subset

### Textbooks
There is **no required text that you will need to purchase** for this course. However, most of the materials in this course will be based on these books, which have great **summaries of the concepts**, and **lots of practice questions and exams**, so they are **recommended** for your own self-study if you wish:
- [Barron's AP Computer Science A - 8th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Barrons-Computer-Science-Bonus-Online-ebook/dp/B07C2C7HH1)
- [McGraw Hill 5 Steps to a 5 - AP Computer Science A (2017)](https://www.amazon.ca/Steps-AP-Computer-Science-2017/dp/0071845909)

I also may be incorporating anything I might have learned from the following selection of Computer Science courses I have completed at UBC that I think may be relevant:
